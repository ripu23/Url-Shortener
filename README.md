# Url-Shortener
The application takes a URL and converts it into tiny url. If there is an exisitng url which matches a url in the database, the system
just returns the shortened version or else, it firstly shortens it and saves it into mongoDB and then returns the tiny url. It is based on Javascript, AngularJS, NodeJS, MongoDB.
I have used 64-bit encoding technique to shorten the URLs.
